# FlexiSaf-Projects

This repository showcases the projects I completed as part of the FlexiSaf Cohort Program, from September 2025 to December 2025.

During this program, I focused on Backend Development using Java at the Beginner-tier.

Here's a live demo of the projects implemented as frontend applications:
